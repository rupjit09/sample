GIT AND GITHUB


Git is an exe file which needs to be installed after installing we will get git bash, git cmd, git GUI. GITHUB is an web interface where we can see the files stored in repository or git server, we need to create and account in github.

Some useful git commands:
1: git --version      -- shows the version
2:git clone githhub repository url (copies the content from github repository  to a local machine and creates a directory in the local machine with the same name as that of the repository)
3:git status
4:git add .
5:git commit –m “First commit”
6:git push (push changes to github)
7:git pull  (get latest file from github)


If there is any situation where two persons A and B pulls the same file C and then both starts modifying the file C, then suppose one of them say A commits the file then B is not having the latest file and B is modifying an existing file so if B tries to commit the file then B will get error saying come conflict issue and B cannot commit his change until B pulls the latest file.
